\# WyneOS Web



This directory contains the public-facing web assets for the WyneOS ecosystem.  

It is a lightweight static entry point that introduces researchers, contributors and the public to the vision and structure of WyneOS.



\## Structure



\- `/app`  

&nbsp; Core routing files for the web front page.



\- `/public`  

&nbsp; Static assets, images and HTML entry points.



\## Purpose



The WyneOS web folder is designed to:



1\. Provide an open introduction to the project.  

2\. Link to documentation, architecture notes and research papers.  

3\. Offer a neutral, vendor-free foundation for future expansions.



More features will be added as the core system evolves.
