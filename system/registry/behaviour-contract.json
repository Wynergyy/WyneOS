  "purpose": "Define behavioural guarantees and operational constraints for WyneOS v1.0, including Phase 9 emergent behaviour.",

  "behaviourModel": {
    "baseline": "System behaviour must remain consistent with sealed manifests and defined phases.",
    "governanceControl": "All behaviour is subject to governance approval and rule enforcement.",
    "stabilityRequirement": "Emergent behaviour must remain within controlled and predictable limits."

  "guaranteedBehaviours": {
    "telemetry": "System provides continuous, accurate heartbeat, sync, and integrity data.",
    "decisionConsistency": "Governance decisions are consistent and repeatable.",
    "integrityProtection": "The system will reject actions that alter sealed or protected files.",
    "predictiveLogic": "Predictive behaviour follows established baselines and models.",
    "emergentBehaviour": "Phase 9 produces higher order behaviour without exceeding stability parameters."
  },

  "restrictedBehaviours": {
    "selfModification": "System cannot modify its own sealed files or manifests.",
    "governanceBypass": "System cannot bypass governance rules under any circumstance.",
    "unsupervisedEmergence": "Phase 9 behaviour cannot operate without stability checks.",
    "runtimeDeviation": "Runtime modules cannot exceed defined operational boundaries."
  },

  "prohibitedBehaviours": [
    "Generating actions that violate sealed integrity files.",
    "Producing behaviours that conflict with governance outcomes.",
    "Altering telemetry outputs dishonestly.",
    "Executing unverified or unauthorised runtime code."

  "responseToDeviation": {
    "detection": "Behaviour outside defined limits triggers a governance review.",
    "automaticAction": "System enters safe mode if integrity or stability is compromised.",
    "audit": "All deviations logged in the audit chain for review.",
    "recovery": "Predictive and emergent modules recalibrated when required."

  "summary": {
    "statement": "This contract ensures WyneOS behaves predictably, safely, and within governance boundaries at all times.",
    "notes": "Behavioural guarantees apply to all 1.x versions unless formally modified."
