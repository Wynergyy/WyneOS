\# WyneOS Genesis Framework



WyneOS Genesis is a safe, modular, local-only framework designed to demonstrate clean engineering, transparent architecture, and long-term maintainability.



This documentation site introduces:



\- The architecture of WyneOS  

\- Core modules and their purpose  

\- How to run the framework  

\- How to extend it in a safe, controlled manner  



WyneOS is not an operating system.  

It is a structured development framework that supports your wider ecosystem.
