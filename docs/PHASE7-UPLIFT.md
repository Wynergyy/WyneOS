WyneOS Phase 7 Uplift Pack



A consolidated architectural and technical summary for the WyneOS operational system.



1\. Purpose of WyneOS



WyneOS is a structured, modular operational system designed to support high-trust environments.

It provides predictable behaviour, auditable integrity and a clear foundation for distributed mesh intelligence.



2\. Phase 7 Objectives



Phase 7 focuses on scaffolding the five core intelligence frameworks:



Integrity Engine



Autonomy Layer



Telemetry Matrix



Predictive Engine



Guardian Mesh



These components enable future distributed analysis, self-healing, coordination and compliance-driven execution.



3\. System Architecture

Integrity Engine



Provides hashing, validation and snapshot generation.

Ensures tamper detection and measurable state changes.



Autonomy Layer



Handles boot logic, behavioural execution and system state management.



Telemetry Matrix



Captures system events and provides a structured observation channel.



Predictive Engine



Provides model registration and analytical prediction capability.



Guardian Mesh



Tracks node health, mesh state and trust structure.
