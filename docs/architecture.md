\# WyneOS Architecture Overview



WyneOS Genesis is a modular, safe, local-only system with five core components:



1\. WAR Runtime  

&nbsp;  Simple route execution engine.



2\. DataFabric  

&nbsp;  Local key-value data layer.



3\. WyneID  

&nbsp;  Transparent identity object with user-controlled claims and consent.



4\. GuardianMesh  

&nbsp;  Manual event recording system.



5\. WYNE-UI  

&nbsp;  Minimal UI components (local rendering only).



All modules avoid:

\- networking

\- telemetry

\- automation

\- system access



The entire platform is designed for safety, clarity, and long-term maintainability.
