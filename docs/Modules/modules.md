# WyneOS Modules Overview

WyneOS is built as a modular, extensible framework.  
Each component serves a distinct purpose while remaining interoperable  
through a stable core architecture.

This document introduces the major modules and their roles.

---

## Core Runtime: WAR (WyneOS Autonomous Runtime)

WAR powers request handling, routing, and lightweight computation.  
It is intentionally minimal to ensure long-term stability.

Key responsibilities:
- route registration  
- payload handling  
- deterministic outputs  

---

## DataFabric

A unified interface for storing structured data.  
Designed for portability and long operational lifespans.

Capabilities:
- key-value storage  
- object persistence  
- local-first operations  

---

## WyneID

Identity built on dignity, security, and clarity.

Provides:
- unique identifier generation  
- namespace safety  
- long-term stable identity primitives  

---

## GuardianMesh

Ethical governance and event oversight.

Handles:
- event registration  
- anomaly detection  
- safety rules  

GuardianMesh enforces trust without surveillance.

---

## How These Modules Align

Each module solves a real-world technical and human challenge:

- WAR ensures predictable behaviour  
- DataFabric maintains integrity and continuity  
- WyneID safeguards identity and structure  
- GuardianMesh preserves safety and trust  

Together they form the foundation of WyneOS:  
a system engineered for longevity, clarity, and public benefit.

## Future Modules

Planned additions include:

- Telemetry Matrix  
- Predictive Engine  
- Observability Layer  
- Integrity Mesh  
- Distributed Knowledge Graph  

All future modules will follow the same principles:  
simple, stable, transparent, and designed for the next century.
