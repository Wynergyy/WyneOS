\# WyneOS Vision Paper: Ethical Design  

Technology With Purpose and Responsibility



Ethical design is one of the most important pillars of WyneOS.  

It guides decisions, structures, and long-term planning.



This paper presents key principles:



\- respect for identity and autonomy  

\- transparency in system behaviour  

\- avoidance of unnecessary data extraction  

\- safety over speed  

\- clarity over complexity  

\- accountability without surveillance  



Ethical design is not a feature—it is a foundation.  

WyneOS carries this principle into every conceptual layer.



Technology should help people thrive, not compromise them.  

This is the message at the heart of WyneOS.
